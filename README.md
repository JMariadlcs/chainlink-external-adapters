# chainlink-external-adapters

This is a workshop used to build an end-to-end DEMO that uses Chainlink Adapters from Chainlink Hackathon Spring 2022.
The workshop followed to complete this repo is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fICFYsN4E74&t=2527s). The used repo that contains some implementations is [this one](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/external-adapters-js) and the cloned repo with the template used is [this one](https://github.com/thodges-gh/CL-EA-NodeJS-Template).

Chainlink External Adapters allows to connect to APIs that are unreachable via de standard [HTTP task](https://docs.chain.link/docs/jobs/task-types/http/). That means that you can connect any API that is avaliable on the Internet to your Smart Contract by using Chainlink nodes through Chainlink external adapters.

- They way it work is like the one in the following figure:

- The API we are going to ask for information is [this one](https://developers.halodotapi.com).
1. Create API KEY.
2. Clone [template repo](https://github.com/thodges-gh/CL-EA-NodeJS-Template).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thodges-gh/CL-EA-NodeJS-Template halo-ea
```
3. Execute:
```bash
cd halo-ea
yarn
```
4. Create `.env` file and paste APY_KEY
5. Install dotenv:
```bash
npm install dotenv
```
6. Modify `index.js` createRequest() function to call to our API.
7. Setup authentification (function headers()).

NOTICE: `index.js` should look like [the one](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/chainlink-external-adapters/blob/main/index.js) included in this repo. -> Feel free to make changes in order to adapt it to your API request

## How to run
1. Execute:
```bash
yarn start
```
2. Open new terminal and execute:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "content type: applications/json" "http://localhost:8080/" --data '{ "id": 1, "data": {{"playerId": "Frosty"} }'
```

You will get the response form the API request! âœ…
